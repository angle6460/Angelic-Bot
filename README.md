# Discord Bot with Economy and Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Discord bot developed when I was 15 years old. The bot includes a basic economy system and a Tic-Tac-Toe game that users can play within a Discord server. The economy system allows users to earn, spend, and manage virtual currency, while the Tic-Tac-Toe game lets users compete against each other with an optional betting system.

## Disclaimer

This code was written when I was 15 years old, and it does not reflect my current coding practices. At the time, I was still learning the basics of programming, and the structure, naming conventions, and overall design of this bot are far from ideal.
## Requirements
